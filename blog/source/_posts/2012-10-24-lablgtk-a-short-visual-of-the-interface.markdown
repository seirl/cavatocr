GTK is an easy way to create interfaces, with the lablGTK library, it is one of
the fastest way to develop small interaction windows like the WinForms in
VisualStudio.

One of the most important thing before using it is to understand the principles
of the partition of the window. After creating the first window you can part it
in two, horizontally or vertically, and this can be reapplied and you can part
the new sections. Moreover you can also part in unequal surfaces.

After this first part, you can add some buttons. The buttons act like the
partitions, you can add one to a partition, and it will naturally take all the
place it can takes, and you can also modify these base to create and develop
everything that you can put in and create the surface of the interfaces.
