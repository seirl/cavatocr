The project's team is composed of these members:

## Antoine \``serialk`\` Pietri (pietri\_a)
*Group Leader − Cloud paradigms innovation consultant*

Antoine is 17 and he begins today his long quest to the power and the
domination of the human race, but still keeps himself very humble and simple.
Earthy character, Antoine spends his days giving orders and sprawling, which
exhausts him. He is very appreciated in the upper class, and is in close
contact with a lot of influent people, whose support he counts on in the
realisation of his CavatOCR project. Once he'd have reached the very top
political power, he plans to gardening, not to be bored during the week-ends.


## Paul \``Dettorer`\` Hervot (hervot\_p)

## Stéphane \``hibiscus`\` Lefebvre (lefebv\_k)

## Thomas Kostas (kostas\_t)
