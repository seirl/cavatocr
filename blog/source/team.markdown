## Antoine \``serialk`\` Pietri (pietri\_a)
*Group Leader − Cloud paradigms innovation consultant*

Antoine is 17 and he begins today his long quest to the power and the
domination of the human race, but still keeps himself very humble and simple.
Earthy character, Antoine spends his days giving orders and sprawling, which
exhausts him. He is very appreciated in the upper class, and is in close
contact with a lot of influent people, whose support he counts on in the
realisation of his CavatOCR project. Once he'd have reached the very top
political power, he plans to gardening, not to be bored during the week-ends.

## Paul \``Dettorer`\` Hervot (hervot\_p)
*'_a consultant*

Paul loves cats so passionately that he sometimes copy their behaviour. He is
calm, patient, always disposed to help his friends, and if you listen carefully,
you can hear him meow! From music and mathematics to systems and networks
administration, he still seeks his own vocation in the vast world of computer
science. His goal with this project is to make his cat read again.

## Thomas \``H2oWalker`\` Kostas (kostas\_t)

*Big Data managing consultant*

My name is Thomas Kostas, I’m 20 years old, I choosed to integrate Epita because
computer science interest me since I'm 10 years old, I would describe myself as
a creative person and I found in computer science a way to express my
creativity. I like to understand how systems work, in this project I worked on
the preprossessing of the image because it was achievable without having a good
knowledge of SDL, but it use some interesting algorithms.
