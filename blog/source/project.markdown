This OCR is our second-year project for the EPITA school.

Every student of the 2016 promotion have to realize an Optical Character
Recognition software during the first semester of EPITA.
The software helps to retrieve in a text editor printed documents. After the
scan, the software attribues to every symbol of the text the matching character
from a neural network trained with sample pictures. It also analyses the
recreated word with a dictionary to reduce the number of errors.

This project is developed in Objective Caml.

We're going to release article during the developement to show you the global
project status.

Thank you for using CavatOCR !
